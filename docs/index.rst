sympyhelpers 
==========================
``sympyhelpers`` provides helper routines and definitions for ``sympy``. In particular, these methods wrap existing ``sympy`` functionality to do Newton-Euler and Lagrangian mechanics using Kane-style and Newton notation and format the outputs to match (some of) the conventions used in various textbooks including Kasdin & Paley (2011).
